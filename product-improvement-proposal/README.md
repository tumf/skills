# Product Improvement Proposal

Propose concrete, high-leverage product and UX improvements to increase a software project's appeal and retention.

This skill is designed for ideation and MVP planning grounded in repo evidence (docs, code signals, commits). It does not implement code changes.

## What You Get

- Persona assumptions (who/why/where the product is used)
- 8-12 specific proposals with evidence signals, effort/risk, and success metrics
- Top-3 prioritized MVP plans (1-2 weeks each)
- A maintainer next-actions checklist

## Example Prompts

- "製品の魅力を上げる改善案を出して。onboarding 重視で"
- "このCLIの appeal を上げたい。1 usability で"
- "競合との差別化（3 differentiation）で、短期で検証できる案を"

## Notes

- Output is in Japanese.
- Claims should cite repo signals when possible; otherwise mark as assumptions.
- Focus on quickly testable ideas rather than long roadmaps.
